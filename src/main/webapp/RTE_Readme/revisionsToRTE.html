               The Sample RTE has been updated to support content packages containing 
               a &lt;ruleCondition&gt; element which references a Global Objective located 
               under the &lt;sequencingCollection&gt; element.  Global Objectives located 
               under the &lt;sequencingCollection&gt; element will now be considered when 
               validating the “referencedObjective” attribute of the &lt;ruleCondition&gt; 
               element if needed.

                The Sample RTE was updated to support content packages utilizing the "../" directory escape 
                sequence used in URI values contained in an imsmanifest.xml file. The escape sequence 
                is now processed and the location which it references is successfully located.

              The Sample RTE was updated to fix a bug where <i>Terminate()</i> was being
              called when the <i>Suspend</i> button is pushed.  This behavior has been corrected

                 The Sample RTE now contains functionality to display
                 API calls made by SCOs launched by the Sample RTE.  To view

                contains no identifierref attribute or if the identifierref 
                attribute is set to an empty string. In this case, the package

               The course import process of the Sample RTE has been updated to 
               conform to the requirement of SCORM 2004 3rd Edition that the 
               <schemaversion> element value equal "2004 3rd Edition". If the 
               SCORM 2004 2nd Edition vocabulary token of "CAM 1.3" is detected, 
               the course import process has been updated to display a warning 
               with the ADL recommendation to update the value to "2004 3rd 
               Edition". It is recommended that the content package manifest be 
               updated because some systems may rely on this value to process 
               the content package.

               The course import process of the Sample RTE has been updated to 
               produce a validation warning when the xsi:schemalocation 
               attribute in the root manifest declaration is not declared. 
            </li>
            <li>
               <!-- 9853 -->
               When no xsi:schemalocation attribute is declared in the root 
               manifest declaration, the Sample RTE provides the XML Parser with 
               a defaulted list of controlling documents to use for XML 
               validation.  The course import process of the Sample RTE has been 
               updated to test for only those controlling document(s) to exist 
               at the root of the content package only if the respective 
               namespace has been declared.

               The course import process of the Sample RTE has been updated to 
               produce a warning when a URI exists multiple times in the IMS 
               Manifest differing only in case.

               The course import process of the Sample RTE has been updated to 
               support content package zip files that contain non-ASCII 
               characters in the file name.      
            </li>

               The Sequencer was updated to ensure that objective state (local 
               and global) is not affected by measure threshold evaluations 
               during tree traversals.
            </li>
            <li>
               Numerous changes were made to the Sample RTE client to align 
               implementation with the updated user interface interoperability 
               requirements defined in the SCORM 2004 3rd Edition Conformance 
               Requirements Document.
