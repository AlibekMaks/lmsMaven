		         The Sample RTE Client Component consists of a sample 
		         user interface implemented in HTML and JavaScript and the 
		         Sample RTE API Instance implemented as a Java Applet. 
		         The Applet is downloaded to the client when the user accesses 
		         the Sample RTE page through a Web browser. This Applet 
		         provides the communication to the Sample RTE Server Component for 
		         Data Model element persistence.  Refer to the JavaDoc Package, 
		         "org.adl.samplerte.client", for details.
