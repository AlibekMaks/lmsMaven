            Welcome to the Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) 2004 
            3rd Edition Sample Run-Time Environment (RTE) Version 1.0.2 
            (Referred to hereafter as Sample RTE).  The Sample RTE is intended 
            to provide an example implementation of the concepts described in 
            the SCORM. Specifically, it was developed in order to provide an 
            example of the SCORM Run-Time Environment (Application Programming 
            Interface (API) and Data Model) and 
            SCORM Sequencing and Navigation as they might be applied in a 
            Learning Management System (LMS) environment.  Robust exception and 
            error handling has not been included in this sample code, nor have
            performance optimizations been considered.
            </p>
   
            <p>
            Even though there are a number of valid Web-enabled SCORM
            implementations, this version of the Sample RTE was implemented as a
            Web-based client/server application using HTML, JavaScript,
            JavaServer Pages (JSP), Java Applets and Java Servlets (Refer to
            the &quot;Design Information&quot; section of this Readme for 
            additional Sample RTE design information).

	                     <li>
	                        For Windows XP: Right click on "My Computer",
	                        select "Properties", select the "Advanced" tab and then
	                        click on "Environment Variables". Add a JAVA_HOME entry

               The Sample RTE has been updated to support content packages containing 
               a &lt;ruleCondition&gt; element which references a Global Objective located 
               under the &lt;sequencingCollection&gt; element.  Global Objectives located 
               under the &lt;sequencingCollection&gt; element will now be considered when 
               validating the “referencedObjective” attribute of the &lt;ruleCondition&gt; 
               element if needed.

            <li><!--- Ticket #11293 --->
                The Sample RTE was updated to support content packages utilizing the "../" directory escape 
                sequence used in URI values contained in an imsmanifest.xml file. The escape sequence 
                is now processed and the location which it references is successfully located.

                 The Sample RTE now contains functionality to display
                 API calls made by SCOs launched by the Sample RTE.  To view 
                 the API calls that have been made by the SCOs, first click on 
                 the <i>Activate Log</i> link in the lower left corner of the
                 Sample RTE and then click on the <i>Show Log</i> link.  The log 
                 will be displayed in the frame immediately above the link.  
                 <i>Hide Log</i> will remove the display of the log string, but 
                 does not delete the log.  <i>Clear Log</i> deletes the current

                The Sample RTE has been updated to display a validation error 
                when importing a package in which there is a leaf item that 
                contains no identifierref attribute or if the identifierref 
                attribute is set to an empty string. In this case, the package 
                may be imported with validation turned off.  However, when 
                running the course contained in that package, if the element 
                with no identifierref attribute is reached, the 
                <i>ERROR</i> page will be displayed.

            	The Sample RTE has been updated to properly implement the 
                sequencing Selection Control element <i>Selection Count</i>.  
                The Selection Control elements enable content developers 
                to define sequencing information that indicates when to select 
                certain activities and to limit the number of activities to be 
                chosen.  The <i>Selection Count</i> element limits the number of 
                activities that are available.

		         The instructions provided are for running the Sample RTE on a 
		         Windows platform.  This is the only platform that the software 
		         has been tested on and is the only platform for which 
		         instructions are provided at this time.
	         </p>
	         <p>
	         	<strong>To Run the Sample RTE:</strong>
	         </p>
	         <p>
		         First, start the apache-tomcat-5.5.20 servlet container and
		         Web server that is provided with this installation.  To do this:
	         	<ol>
		            <li>
			            Click on the shortcut at Start Menu -> All Programs -> ADL -> 
			            SCORM_2004_3rd_Edition_Sample_Run-Time_Environment_version_1.0.2 -> Start Server.  You will see a command 
			            prompt window appear and show several lines of textual 
			            information.  This window will remain open until you stop 
			            the server.
		            </li>
		            <li>
			            Next click on the Start Menu -> All Programs -> ADL -> 
                        SCORM_2004_3rd_Edition_Sample_Run-Time_Environment_version_1.0.2 -> SCORM 2004 3rd Edition Sample Run-Time Environment version 1.0.2. This will launch 
                        the Sample RTE Main page.  Log in with the username: 
                        "admin", password: "admin".  
                        (Be sure that Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 or greater
			            is your default browser.)
		            </li>
	        		</ol>
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	           	Online help pages are available once the Sample RTE is started.
	           	"Help" links appear at the bottom of each page.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	          	To close the Sample RTE, first close the browser in which it is 
                running.  To stop the apache-tomcat-5.5.20 servlet container 
                and Web server, click on the 
                Start Menu -> All Programs -> ADL -> SCORM_2004_3rd_Edition_Sample_Run-Time_Environment_version_1.0.2 -> Stop Server.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	           	To return the Sample RTE to a "clean" state, log into the Sample 
	           	RTE and from the main menu choose the Clear Database option.  
	           	This will remove all course files that have been imported as 
	           	well as any information associated with them, including IMS SSP
                buckets and related information; and will remove all user 
                registration information. All Global Objective information will 
                also be removed.

	         	   <strong>Course Navigation User Interface</strong>
	          </p>
		        <p>
			        In addition to any User Interface (UI) controls provided within course 
			        content, the Sample RTE provides several mechanisms for navigating through 
			        a course that are conformant to Section 2.1.7 of the SCORM 2004 3rd Edition 
			        Conformance Requirements Version 1.0.  These mechanisms include the navigation 
			        buttons in the top frame of the Sample RTE, such as the Quit, Suspend, 
			        Previous, and Continue buttons, and the Table of Contents provided in 
			        the left-hand frame.
		        </p>
	         
		        <p>
		          <strong>Navigation Buttons</strong>
		        </p>
		        
		        <p>
		           The navigation buttons provided by the Sample RTE in the top frame 
		           will be visible when they are not explicitly “hidden” by an activity 
		           via the hideLMSUI element within the manifest.  When an activity 
		           explicitly hides any of the buttons, they will not appear in the 
		           top frame.
		        </p>
		        
		        <p>
		           The following describes the behavior of the navigation buttons when 
		           they are not hidden:
		        </p>
		        
		        <p>
			        <ul>
			           <li>
			              Quit – This button will issue an Exit All navigation request 
			              to the Sample RTE’s Sequencer; the Sample RTE will end a user’s current 
			              attempt on a course.  The user’s progress and course status 
			              information for the current attempt will no longer be available 
			              if  the user makes another attempt on the course.
			           </li>
			           <li>
			              Suspend – This button will issue a Suspend All navigation request 
			              to the Sample RTE’s Sequencer; the Sample RTE will end a user’s 
			              current attempt on a course and will also ‘bookmark’ the user’s 
			              position within the course.  The user’s progress and course status 
			              information will be persisted.  When the user starts the course 
			              again, they will resume the course from the same content they 
			              triggered the suspend.
			           </li>
			           <li>
			              Previous – This button will issue a Previous navigation request 
			              to the Sample RTE’s Sequencer, resulting in launching the activity 
			              identified prior to the current activity in the course’s activity 
			              tree.
			           </li>
			           <li>
			              Continue – This button will issue a Continue navigation request 
			              to the Sample RTE’s Sequencer, resulting in launching the  
			              activity identified after the  the current activity in the 
			              course’s activity tree.
			           </li>
			        </ul>
		        </p>
		        
		        <p>
		          <strong>Table of Contents</strong>
		        </p>
		        
		        <p>
		           A Table of Contents (TOC) will be provided by the Sample RTE when 
		           a course includes  Choice equal to “true” anywhere within its 
		           activity tree.  When a course includes Choice equal to “false” at 
		           every level of its activity tree, the table of contents will not 
		           appear.
		        </p>
		        
		        <p>
		           The following describes the items in the TOC when Choice is set to 
		           “true” in the course:
		        </p>
		        
		        <p>
			        <ul>
			           <li>
			              Selectable – Items that are selectable will be indicated with 
			              black text and the cursor will change as the user mouses over them.
			           </li>
			           <li>
			              Not Selectable – Items that are not selectable will be indicated 
			              by gray text or  black text and the cursor that does not change 
			              when the user mouses over them.
			           </li>
			        </ul>

	         	<h5 class="title">Sample Run-Time Environment Server Component</h5>
	         </p>
	         <p>
		         The Sample RTE Server Component is implemented using 
		         Java Servlets and Java Applications. The Servlets respond to 
		         requests from the Run-time Environment Client Component and are 
		         responsible for Data Model persistence as well as sequencing and 
		         parsing logic.  The source files for the server component are located
		         beneath the Sample_RTE\source\src directory.  In addition, the JavaDoc
		         associated with the source files is located at Sample_RTE\api\index.html.
		         The modules that make up the Server Component are listed below:
	         </p>
	         <ul>
	            <li>
	               <i>ADL Validator</i>: This module is responsible for validating
	               the imsmanifest.xml file that is required in SCORM Content
	               Aggregation Content Packages.  The ADL 
                   Validator is also responsible for parsing the XML file and 
                   returning a DOM tree representation to the Sample RTE Server 
                   Component. <i>Refer to the JavaDoc Package, "org.adl.validator"

	               <i>Administrative</i>: This module contains files that change
	               passwords, delete courses, manage global objectives, create or
	               delete users, delete courses and clear the Sample RTE database.
	               The files that make up the Administrative module are located 
                   in the "admin" directory.
	            </li>
	            <li>

                   are located in the "help" directory.
	            </li>
	            <li>
	               <i>Import</i>: This module is responsible for managing the course
	               import process.  These files utilize the Sample RTE Server side 
	               Java Component to handle parsing, validation and database access. 
	               The files that make up the Import module are located in the

	            </li>
	            <li>
	               <i>Includes</i>:  The Sample RTE utilizes a style sheet (*.css)
	               that handles the interface look and feel.  See
	               sampleRTE_style.css for details.  This file is located in the

	            </li>
	            <li>
	               <i>Run-Time</i>:  This module contains the files used to deliver
	               a SCORM Conformant Content Aggregation Content Package.  
                 In addition, the SCORM API is included.  All images used in

                 located in this module.  The files that make up the Run-Time 
                 module are located in the "runtime" directory.
	            </li>
	            <li>
	               <i>Special State</i>: This module contains information pages that
	               describe special sequencing states.  It is possible that content
	               will not be delivered as result of a sequencing request.  In that
	               event these pages inform the user about what state the sequencer
	               is in.  <strong>Note:</strong>  These pages are included to help debug sequencing
	               in content.  There is no requirement by the SCORM that they be
	               presented.  LMSs may handle sequencing states in their
	               own manner.  The files that make up the Special State

	         <p>
	         	<strong>
	            	<strong>Note:</strong> It is not a requirement to build the Sample RTE 
                    before using it.  It will install as a fully operational 
                    unit.  It is only necessary to build the Sample RTE if the 
                    source code has been changed.
	         	</strong>
	         </p>
	         <p>
		         <em>In order to compile the Sample RTE, the full installation
		         instructions must be completed first.</em>  The Sample RTE 
		         build file depends on a full apache-tomcat-5.5.20 install, 
		         along with resources provided in the installation of the Sample RTE.  
                 It is important to note that when the Sample RTE is built, it 
                 overwrites the previously installed Sample RTE. To move back 
                 to the original Sample RTE, the un-install must be executed and then 
                 the downloaded self-extracting executable must be re-run.
	         </p>
	         <p>
		         The Sample RTE is built using Apache Ant, a Java-based build tool.
		         <b>Before building the Sample RTE, Apache Ant must be installed.</b>
		         For information about and downloads of Ant, refer to
	         	<a href="http://ant.apache.org/" target="_blank">http://ant.apache.org/</a>.
	         </p>
	
	         <em>
	         	To build the Sample RTE:
	         </em>
	         <ul>
	            <li>
	            	Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where the
	               Sample RTE is installed (Default: C:\ADL\SCORM_2004_3rd_Ed_Sample_RTE_V1.0.2)
	            </li>
	            <li>
	            	From this point, navigate to the Sample_RTE\source directory
	            </li>
	            <li>
	            	At the prompt type "ant".
	            </li>
	         </ul>
	         
	         <p>
		         The XML Ant build files will compile all Java class and jar files
		         needed by the Sample RTE.  In addition the files will be 
		         installed to apache-tomcat.  
		         (<strong>Note:</strong> For changes to take effect, the tomcat server will need 
		         to be restarted).  This completes the compilation of the Sample 
		         RTE.
	         </p>
	         
	         <p>
	         	<em>Source File Locations</em>
	         	<ul>
	            	<li>
	            		All JSP, HTML, and JavaScript files are located at
	                	&lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;install_directory&gt;\Sample_RTE\source\SampleRTE\LMSClient.
	             	</li>
	             	<li>
	             		The Sample RTE Java files are located in their respective
	                	package locations.  For example the data model classes are 
	                	located at "org\adl\datamodels".  The root of the Java 
	                	source directory is 
	                	&lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;install_directory&gt;\Sample_RTE\source\src.
	                 	Here you will find the build script and the root "org"
	                 	directory.

	                  It is possible that switching between different
