	               <li>
	                  Create an environment variable named "JAVA_HOME" and set

	                     <li>
	                        For Windows XP: Right click on "My Computer",

	                        click on "Environment Variables". Add a JAVA_HOME entry

	                        location where the Java Development Kit was installed

	                  another root installation directory, but the Sample RTE
	                  install will always append the 
	                  &quot;\ADL\SCORM_2004_3rd_Ed_Sample_RTE_V1.0.2&quot; sub-directory to the
	                  specified root installation directory.  The remainder

	            <h5 class="title">Uninstalling The Sample RTE</h5>
	         </p>
	         There are two methods that can be used for uninstalling the Sample RTE:<br>
           <ul>
           	  <li>Uninstall the Sample RTE using the Windows Control Panel.</li>
           	  <ul>
	              <li> For Windows XP, the Windows Control Panel "Add/Remove 
	              Programs" feature can be used.
	                 <ol>	                    
	                    <li>Open the Windows "Control Panel"
	                    <li>Double-Click on "Add or Remove Programs" icon
	                    <li>Highlight the  "ADL SCORM 2004 3rd Ed. Sample Run-Time 
	                    Environment Version 1.0.2"
	                    <li>Click "Remove" and follow the instructions
	                    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
	                    </li>
	                 </ol>
	              </li>
	              <li>For Windows Vista, the Windows Control Panel "Programs and 
	              Features" feature can be used.
	                 <ol>	                    
	                    <li>Open the Windows "Control Panel"
	                    <li>Double-Click on "Programs and Features" icon
	                    <li>Highlight the "ADL SCORM 2004 3rd Ed. Sample Run-Time 
	                    Environment Version 1.0.2"
	                    <li>Click "Uninstall" on the toolbar above the list and follow the instructions
	                    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
	                    </li>
	                 </ol>
	              </li>
	          </ul>
              <li>If this version of the Sample RTE is already installed, running the install 
                 again will uninstall the software. This method will not re-install 
                 the Sample RTE. You will need to run the install a third
                 time to accomplish a re-installation.</li>
              </ul>
           <strong>Note:</strong> The Sample Run-Time Environment may not appear 
           in the "Add/Remove Programs" menu. If it does not appear, use the 
           second method for uninstalling.
           <br /><br />
           
           These methods of uninstalling will not remove files or directories that
           have been altered in the course of running the Sample RTE.  In order to 
           complete the process of uninstalling the Sample RTE, the following steps
           will need to be completed:
           
           <ol>
              <li>Delete the directory that the Sample RTE was installed to
                  (&lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;Install Directory&gt;\SCORM_2004_3rd_Ed_Sample_RTE_V1.0.2 by default) along with any
                  files or directories contained within it</li>
              <li>Delete the &lt;drive&gt;:\SCORM3EDSampleRTE102Files directory</li>
           </ol>
