		         The instructions provided are for running the Sample RTE on a 
		         Windows platform.  This is the only platform that the software 
		         has been tested on and is the only platform for which 
		         instructions are provided at this time.
	         </p>
	         <p>
	         	<strong>To Run the Sample RTE:</strong>
	         </p>
	         <p>
		         First, start the apache-tomcat-5.5.20 servlet container and
		         Web server that is provided with this installation.  To do this:
	         	<ol>
		            <li>
			            Click on the shortcut at Start Menu -> All Programs -> ADL -> 
			            SCORM_2004_3rd_Edition_Sample_Run-Time_Environment_version_1.0.2 -> Start Server.  You will see a command 
			            prompt window appear and show several lines of textual 
			            information.  This window will remain open until you stop 
			            the server.
		            </li>
		            <li>
			            Next click on the Start Menu -> All Programs -> ADL -> 
                        SCORM_2004_3rd_Edition_Sample_Run-Time_Environment_version_1.0.2 -> SCORM 2004 3rd Edition Sample Run-Time Environment version 1.0.2. This will launch 
                        the Sample RTE Main page.  Log in with the username: 
                        "admin", password: "admin".  
                        (Be sure that Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 or greater
			            is your default browser.)
		            </li>
	        		</ol>
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	           	Online help pages are available once the Sample RTE is started.
	           	"Help" links appear at the bottom of each page.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	          	To close the Sample RTE, first close the browser in which it is 
                running.  To stop the apache-tomcat-5.5.20 servlet container 
                and Web server, click on the 
                Start Menu -> All Programs -> ADL -> SCORM_2004_3rd_Edition_Sample_Run-Time_Environment_version_1.0.2 -> Stop Server.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	           	To return the Sample RTE to a "clean" state, log into the Sample 
	           	RTE and from the main menu choose the Clear Database option.  
	           	This will remove all course files that have been imported as 
	           	well as any information associated with them, including IMS SSP
                buckets and related information; and will remove all user 
                registration information. All Global Objective information will 
                also be removed.
	        	</p>

	         	   <strong>Course Navigation User Interface</strong>
	          </p>
		        <p>
			        In addition to any User Interface (UI) controls provided within course 
			        content, the Sample RTE provides several mechanisms for navigating through 
			        a course that are conformant to Section 2.1.7 of the SCORM 2004 3rd Edition 
			        Conformance Requirements Version 1.0.  These mechanisms include the navigation 
			        buttons in the top frame of the Sample RTE, such as the Quit, Suspend, 
			        Previous, and Continue buttons, and the Table of Contents provided in 
			        the left-hand frame.
		        </p>
	         
		        <p>
		          <strong>Navigation Buttons</strong>
		        </p>
		        
		        <p>
		           The navigation buttons provided by the Sample RTE in the top frame 
		           will be visible when they are not explicitly “hidden” by an activity 
		           via the hideLMSUI element within the manifest.  When an activity 
		           explicitly hides any of the buttons, they will not appear in the 
		           top frame.
		        </p>
		        
		        <p>
		           The following describes the behavior of the navigation buttons when 
		           they are not hidden:
		        </p>
		        
		        <p>
			        <ul>
			           <li>
			              Quit – This button will issue an Exit All navigation request 
			              to the Sample RTE’s Sequencer; the Sample RTE will end a user’s current 
			              attempt on a course.  The user’s progress and course status 
			              information for the current attempt will no longer be available 
			              if  the user makes another attempt on the course.
			           </li>
			           <li>
			              Suspend – This button will issue a Suspend All navigation request 
			              to the Sample RTE’s Sequencer; the Sample RTE will end a user’s 
			              current attempt on a course and will also ‘bookmark’ the user’s 
			              position within the course.  The user’s progress and course status 
			              information will be persisted.  When the user starts the course 
			              again, they will resume the course from the same content they 
			              triggered the suspend.
			           </li>
			           <li>
			              Previous – This button will issue a Previous navigation request 
			              to the Sample RTE’s Sequencer, resulting in launching the activity 
			              identified prior to the current activity in the course’s activity 
			              tree.
			           </li>
			           <li>
			              Continue – This button will issue a Continue navigation request 
			              to the Sample RTE’s Sequencer, resulting in launching the  
			              activity identified after the  the current activity in the 
			              course’s activity tree.
			           </li>
			        </ul>
		        </p>
		        
		        <p>
		          <strong>Table of Contents</strong>
		        </p>
		        
		        <p>
		           A Table of Contents (TOC) will be provided by the Sample RTE when 
		           a course includes  Choice equal to “true” anywhere within its 
		           activity tree.  When a course includes Choice equal to “false” at 
		           every level of its activity tree, the table of contents will not 
		           appear.
		        </p>
		        
		        <p>
		           The following describes the items in the TOC when Choice is set to 
		           “true” in the course:
		        </p>
		        
		        <p>
			        <ul>
			           <li>
			              Selectable – Items that are selectable will be indicated with 
			              black text and the cursor will change as the user mouses over them.
			           </li>
			           <li>
			              Not Selectable – Items that are not selectable will be indicated 
			              by gray text or  black text and the cursor that does not change 
			              when the user mouses over them.
			           </li>
			        </ul>
		        </p>
